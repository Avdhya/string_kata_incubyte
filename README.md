# string_kata_incubyte
This project implements the String Calculator Kata using Node.js and Jest for practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal is to build a simple string calculator that adds numbers provided in a string format.
while following a series of incremental steps:

# Returns 0 for an empty string.
# Sums numbers separated by commas or new lines.
# Supports custom delimiters.
# Throws errors for negative numbers.
# Ignores numbers greater than 1000.

Run tests using npm test to validate the solution as the functionality is built out step by step.
